# Visual-FSM-Designer-for-FPGA
An FPGA state machine visual design tool based on logic driver. It breaks the traditional inefficient model of "manual drawing and manual writing of code". It enters logic through structured tables, generates cross-free state transition diagrams in real time, and automatically exports Verilog code.
